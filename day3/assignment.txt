ASSIGNMENT:
- define a Queue interface and implement it using array: 2 distinct implementations
	- enqueue, dequeue and empty as operations
- define a Stack interface and implement it using array: 2 distinct implementations
	- push and pop, empty as operations
- define a Set interface and implement it using array: 2 distinct implementations
		- adding a value to the set
		- checking if value in set
		- sets intersection obtaining a third one with common values
		- sets reunion obtaining a third one with all values

- write a function that returns an interator over a huge numbers of random numbers that are ascending (current random number greater than the last one), given
that the number of random values to return is passed as function argument and the difference between two consecutive random numbers cannot be more than 10.
